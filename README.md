# Turtle Graphics Control Program

This project is a simple Python program that uses the Turtle graphics library to create an interactive drawing environment. Control the movement of the turtle on the screen using specific keys to draw shapes, move around, and reset the screen.

## Features
- **Move Forwards** - Move the turtle forward by 10 units with the `w` key.
- **Move Backwards** - Move the turtle backward by 10 units with the `s` key.
- **Turn Left** - Rotate the turtle 10 degrees to the left with the `a` key.
- **Turn Right** - Rotate the turtle 10 degrees to the right with the `r` key.
- **Clear Screen** - Clear all drawings and reset the turtle's position with the `c` key.

## Code Overview

### Importing Modules
We use the Turtle and Screen classes from the `turtle` module to create our drawing environment and capture keyboard events.

```python
from turtle import Turtle, Screen
